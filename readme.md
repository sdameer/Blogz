## 📚 How It Was Built

This project was a solo effort developed as part of my Django learning journey. I used tools like **Claude AI** to design the entire frontend and **Gemini AI** to help generate SEO-friendly blog titles. Authentication was handled using **Djoser** and **OAuth**, and the final application was deployed using **Render**.
